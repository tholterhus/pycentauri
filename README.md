Local-network toolkit for [Elegoo Centauri Carbon](https://www.elegoo.com/)
3D printers — the **original Centauri Carbon (CC1)** and the **Centauri
Carbon 2 (CC2)**. One async client, six surfaces: Python library, CLI,
MCP server for AI agents, REST/SSE HTTP server, built-in web dashboard,
and an RTSP bridge for your NVR.

No cloud account, no Elegoo servers — everything talks directly to the
printer on your LAN. `pycentauri` auto-detects which model it's talking
to and speaks the right protocol:

| | CC1 | CC2 |
|---|---|---|
| Transport | SDCP v3 over WebSocket (`:3030`) | JSON-RPC over MQTT (`:1883`) |
| Auth | none | access code (printer screen) |
| Discovery | UDP broadcast | direct IP + HTTP bootstrap |
| Webcam | MJPEG `:3031` | MJPEG `:8080` |
| Live head speed | — | ✓ (`gcode_move.speed` ÷ 60 = the screen's mm/s readout) |
| Fan channels | 3 | 5 |
| Canvas multi-filament | — | ✓ (status + auto-refill) |
| File management | list, upload, delete, history | list, upload, delete, disk info, history |
| Filament-switch detection | — | ✓ (position-based) |

> **Status:** alpha, but used daily against real printers. Protocols were
> reverse-engineered from Elegoo's official
> [`elegoo-link`](https://github.com/ELEGOO-3D/elegoo-link) C++ SDK, the
> [`CentauriLink`](https://github.com/CentauriLink/Centauri-Link) project,
> and live wire captures. CC1 tested on firmware V1.1.46 and OpenCentauri
> V0.3.0-o; CC2 tested on firmware 01.03.02.51. Full wire-protocol notes
> live in [`docs/PROTOCOL.md`](docs/PROTOCOL.md).

## Install

For a Python/library installation:

```sh
pip install pycentauri                    # library + CLI
pip install "pycentauri[mcp]"             # + MCP server
pip install "pycentauri[server]"          # + HTTP REST/SSE server + web UI
pip install "pycentauri[mcp,server]"      # all Python surfaces
pip install "pycentauri[detect]"          # + failed-print detection (Coral/CPU)
```

For a Linux service installation with an optional systemd unit, see the
complete [Linux installation guide](INSTALL.md). It covers prerequisites,
configuration, firewalling, reverse proxies, multiple devices, health checks,
updates, and rollback. The installer defaults to loopback binding and
read-only operation; no credentials belong in source control or shell history.

The RTSP bridge additionally requires
[MediaMTX](https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/releases) and `ffmpeg`
on `$PATH`.

Python 3.10+. Core dependencies: `websockets`, `paho-mqtt`, `httpx`,
`typer`, `pydantic`.

## Connecting to your printer

**CC1** needs only its IP (or nothing at all — it answers UDP discovery).

**CC2** needs its IP *and* its access code, found on the printer's
touchscreen under network/connectivity settings. Pass it as
`--access-code` / `access_code=` / `ACCESS_CODE`. The examples
below use `ACCESS_CODE` as a stand-in — substitute your own.

> **Enable "LAN Only" mode on the CC2** (network settings on the
> touchscreen). The CC2 gates its local API behind it — with LAN Only
> off the printer works through Elegoo's cloud and leaves the local HTTP
> endpoint closed, so pycentauri can't reach it and you'll get a
> connection error. This is required on firmware 2.0 and recommended on
> all CC2 firmware.

Every CLI command accepts `--host` (env: `HOST`). With no host
given, commands try UDP discovery, which only finds CC1s.

## CLI

```sh
# Discovery (CC1 only — CC2 doesn't answer broadcasts)
centauri discover

# Status, attributes, live watch, snapshot
centauri status     --host printer.example                        # CC1
centauri status     --host printer-cc2.example --access-code ACCESS_CODE   # CC2
centauri status     --host printer.example --json
centauri attributes --host printer.example
centauri watch      --host printer.example
centauri snapshot   --host printer.example shot.jpg

# Upload a file, then print it — all writes require --enable-control
centauri upload model.gcode         --host printer.example --enable-control
centauri upload model.gcode --start --host printer.example --enable-control

# Print control
centauri print start model.gcode --host printer.example --enable-control
centauri print pause             --host printer.example --enable-control
centauri print resume            --host printer.example --enable-control
centauri print stop              --host printer.example --enable-control

# Live adjust while printing
centauri speed sport                            --host printer.example --enable-control

centauri temp --nozzle 215 --bed 60             --host printer.example --enable-control

# File management (both models; `disk` is CC2-only)
centauri files        --host printer.example                             # CC1
centauri files --storage u-disk --host printer-cc2.example --access-code ACCESS_CODE
centauri disk         --host printer-cc2.example --access-code ACCESS_CODE        # CC2 only
centauri history      --host printer.example                             # CC1 or CC2
centauri delete old.gcode --host printer.example --enable-control

# Chamber light (both models)
centauri light on   --host printer-cc2.example --access-code ACCESS_CODE --enable-control
centauri light off  --host printer-cc2.example --access-code ACCESS_CODE --enable-control

# Canvas multi-filament (CC2 only)
centauri canvas       --host printer-cc2.example --access-code ACCESS_CODE
centauri refill --on  --host printer-cc2.example --access-code ACCESS_CODE --enable-control
```

`centauri canvas` prints each tray's filament, color, temperature range,
and loaded state:

```
auto_refill  : OFF
active_tray  : none
connected    : yes

canvas #0:
  ● tray 0: PLA Wood (PLA) #F72221 [190-230°C]
  ● tray 1: PLA Wood (PLA) #AF7832 [190-230°C]
  ● tray 2: PETG (PETG) #A03BF7 [230-260°C]
  ● tray 3: PLA Wood (PLA) #D2C5A3 [190-230°C]
```

### Speed modes

Both printers accept exactly four speed settings — arbitrary percentages
are silently ignored by the firmware:

| Mode | CC1 wire value (`PrintSpeedPct`) | CC2 wire value (`speed_mode`) |
|---|---|---|
| `silent` | 50 | 0 |
| `balanced` | 100 | 1 |
| `sport` | 130 | 2 |
| `ludicrous` | 160 | 3 |

Speed changes only take effect while a print is actively running.

#### CC2 speed pinning

Historically the CC2 firmware reset the speed mode back to balanced on
every Canvas filament switch, losing your choice. pycentauri works
around it by **pinning** the mode you set and re-applying it when a
filament switch completes (CC2 only, requires `--enable-control`):

- The mode you set via pycentauri is *pinned*.
- When a Canvas filament switch finishes, the pinned mode is re-applied
  once (harmless if the firmware didn't reset it).
- The pin clears when the print ends.

A note on firmware: on **02.01.00.00** the printer no longer exposes a
stable "set speed mode" over the wire — `gcode_move.speed_mode` in the
real-time stream is the *current move's* speed factor, which varies per
feature. pycentauri therefore treats the pin as an explicit setting and
never infers or enforces it from that noisy value; it only re-applies
your pinned mode on switch completion. To change speed, set it through
pycentauri (the dashboard, `centauri speed`, etc.).

The CC1 has none of this — its speed mode stays where you put it, so
`set_print_speed` is a plain one-shot there.

## Python library

```python
import asyncio
from pycentauri import Printer, CC2Printer, connect_auto


async def main():
    # Explicit CC1
    async with await Printer.connect("printer.example") as printer:
        st = await printer.status()
        print(st.print_status, st.progress, st.temp_nozzle)

    # Explicit CC2
    async with await CC2Printer.connect(
        "printer-cc2.example", access_code="ACCESS_CODE"
    ) as printer:
        st = await printer.status()
        print(st.temp_nozzle, st.raw["_cc2"]["gcode_move_speed"])  # mm/min; ÷60 = screen's mm/s

        canvas = await printer.canvas_status()
        for unit in canvas.canvas_list:
            for tray in unit.tray_list:
                print(tray.tray_id, tray.filament_name, tray.filament_color)

    # Auto-detect — port-probes :3030 vs :1883 and returns the right class
    async with await connect_auto("printer-cc2.example", access_code="ACCESS_CODE") as printer:
        attrs = await printer.attributes()
        print(attrs.machine_name, attrs.firmware_version)


asyncio.run(main())
```

Both classes expose the same API: `status()`, `attributes()`, `watch()`
(async iterator of live status), `snapshot()`, `upload_file()`,
`start_print()`, `pause()`, `resume()`, `stop()`, `set_print_speed()`,
`set_fan_speed()`, `set_temperatures()`, `set_light()`, `list_files()`,
`delete_files()`, `disk_info()`, `print_history()`, `canvas_status()`,
`set_auto_refill()`. Write methods require `enable_control=True` at
connect time and raise `ControlDisabledError` otherwise. File
management and Canvas methods raise `PrinterError` on CC1 (not
available over SDCP).

`upload_file(local_path, *, remote_name=None, progress=None)` pushes a
file to the printer's internal storage over chunked HTTP (independent of
the control channel, so it can't disrupt a print) and returns the name
`start_print()` expects — so the typical flow is `await
p.upload_file("model.gcode")` then `await p.start_print(...)`. The
optional `progress` callback receives `(bytes_sent, total_bytes)`.

CC2-only telemetry rides along in `Status.raw["_cc2"]`: the live head
speed (`gcode_move_speed` — the commanded speed of the current move in
**mm/min**; divide by 60 for the mm/s figure the printer's screen
shows), `speed_mode`, filament runout sensor state,
firmware-computed `remaining_time_sec`, `machine_status`/`sub_status`
raw codes, and `external_device` (camera / U-disk presence).

## HTTP server + web UI

```sh
# Read-only, loopback only
centauri server --host printer.example

# Read + write + RTSP, on the LAN (put an authenticating proxy in front)
centauri server --host printer.example --bind 0.0.0.0 --port 8787 \
                --enable-control --rtsp

# CC2
centauri server --host printer-cc2.example --access-code ACCESS_CODE \
                --bind 0.0.0.0 --port 8787 --enable-control

# Opt in to a dashboard "update available" badge (the only outbound call;
# off by default — a cached PyPI check every 12 h, fail-silent)
centauri server --host printer.example --check-updates
```

The server holds a single long-lived connection to the printer
(WebSocket for CC1, MQTT for CC2) with automatic reconnect and
exponential backoff — it will never exhaust CC1's 5-connection limit.

The **web UI** at `/ui/` is a clean dark dashboard, mobile-friendly and
dependency-free (no CDN assets — works on an air-gapped LAN): live
webcam, job progress with layer/ETA, printer state, thermals, kinematics
(with live head speed on CC2), pause/resume/stop, speed-mode selector,
fan and heater sliders that hydrate from live values, a Canvas panel
with per-tray color swatches and an auto-refill toggle (CC2), and RTSP
bridge controls. Control panels only render when the server was started
with `--enable-control`.

### Where you'll want the dashboard

- **Phone** — installable PWA: open `/ui/`, use "Add to Home Screen",
  and it runs fullscreen like a native app.
- **Browser tab** — just `http://<server>:8787/ui/` on any machine.
- **OrcaSlicer** — under *Print Host upload* (Host type *Elegoo Link*),
  put `http://<server>:8787/ui/` into the **Device UI** field; the
  printer tab then shows this dashboard instead of the vendor cloud
  page.

All three share the same server, so each viewer counts once for the
camera. One extra "viewer" is the failed-print detection: while a print
runs it subscribes to the same stream (no second camera slot), so the
camera stays on for the whole print even when no dashboard is open —
that is the monitoring working.

**When exactly is the camera on?** The stream runs while at least one
of these holds, and sleeps the moment none does:

| Camera is on when… | Because |
|---|---|
| any UI client is open (PWA, browser tab, OrcaSlicer Device UI) | someone is watching |
| a print runs **and** detection is enabled (`DETECT=1`) | the detector is watching |
| a print runs **and** frame collection is on | training frames are being saved |

With detection (and collection) disabled, the camera — and its network
traffic — is therefore only live while you have a dashboard open; idle
printer overnight = silent network. See the network-load note in the
detection section for the bandwidth numbers.

the route isn't registered at all.

Temperature writes are bounds-checked server-side: nozzle 0–300 °C,
bed 0–110 °C, chamber 0–60 °C.

## MCP server (AI agents)

Give Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any MCP client eyes and
hands on your printer:

```sh
# Read-only (status, snapshot, attributes, discovery, canvas)
claude mcp add pycentauri --env HOST=printer.example \
    -- python -m pycentauri.mcp

# With control tools
claude mcp add pycentauri-cc2 \
    --env HOST=printer-cc2.example \
    --env ACCESS_CODE=ACCESS_CODE \
    -- python -m pycentauri.mcp --enable-control
```

The target host is pinned in the server's environment at spawn time — a
prompt-injected agent cannot redirect commands to an arbitrary IP,
because no tool takes a host parameter.

| Tool | Availability | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `get_status` | always | State, temps, progress, layer, position, fans |
| `get_attributes` | always | Model, firmware, mainboard ID |
| `get_snapshot` | always | Webcam frame as MCP image — the model *sees* the print |
| `discover_printers` | always | UDP LAN scan |
| `get_canvas_status` | always | Canvas trays, colors, auto-refill (CC2) |
| `start_print` | `--enable-control` | Start a file already on the printer |
| `pause_print` / `resume_print` / `stop_print` | `--enable-control` | Job control |
| `set_print_speed` | `--enable-control` | `silent`/`balanced`/`sport`/`ludicrous` |
| `set_fan_speed` | `--enable-control` | Any subset of model/aux/chamber, 0–100% |
| `set_temperatures` | `--enable-control` | Any subset of nozzle/bed/chamber, °C |
| `set_auto_refill` | `--enable-control` | Canvas auto-refill toggle (CC2) |

Control tools aren't merely gated — without the flag they are never
registered, so they don't appear in the model's tool list at all.

## RTSP bridge

Re-streams the printer's MJPEG webcam as H.264/RTSP for clients that
don't speak MJPEG — Home Assistant, Frigate, Jellyfin, Synology
Surveillance, VLC:

```sh
# Standalone (foreground, Ctrl-C to stop)
centauri rtsp --host printer.example
# → rtsp://<this-host>:8554/printer

# Integrated with the HTTP server — adds a STREAM panel to the web UI
centauri server --host printer.example --rtsp --bind 0.0.0.0
```

MediaMTX only runs the ffmpeg transcode while a client is connected, so
idle cost is zero. Tunables: `--fps`, `--bitrate`, `--preset`, `--path`,
`--port` (standalone) or the `--rtsp-*` variants on `centauri server`.
The bridge picks the correct camera port for CC1 vs CC2 automatically.

## Spaghetti detection (Coral USB / Edge TPU)

While a print is running, pycentauri watches the printer's own webcam
through an object-detection model and raises an alert when the print has
failed into a stringy mess ("spaghetti"). On a Google Coral USB Accelerator
each look costs ~5–15 ms; without a Coral the same model runs on the CPU
(~200 ms at 1 frame/s — a Coral is optional). The detector taps the same
shared camera stream as the dashboard (the printer never sees a second
camera connection), skips the first `--detect-grace` seconds of a print,
and fires at most one alert per print when ≥ 4 of the last 6 frames show a
detection. The dashboard gains a **DETECT** panel with live state and
evidence snapshots.

### Quick start

```sh
# 1. install with the detection extra (see INSTALL.md for a full walkthrough)
pip install 'pycentauri[detect,server]'

# 2. fetch a model — the repository ships none
./scripts/fetch-smoke-model.sh

# 3. optional: install the Edge TPU runtime for a Coral
#    (see INSTALL.md, "Failed-print detection (Coral) — step by step")
#    No Coral? Skip this — detection then runs on the CPU, ~200 ms per
#    look instead of ~5-15 ms. Everything else behaves identically.
#    The CPU path works on x86-64, ARM-64 (Raspberry Pi) and macOS.
#    The Coral runs on Linux x86-64 AND ARM-64 (e.g. Raspberry Pi);
#    only the model *compiler* is x86-64-only (see scripts/train/README.md).

# 4. verify and run
centauri detect check
centauri server --host printer.example --enable-control \
    --detect --detect-action notify
```

Notes:

- **The smoke model detects everyday objects, not spaghetti.** It proves
  the pipeline end to end; a real spaghetti model is trained separately —
  the full journey (data collection, training, Edge TPU compilation) is
  documented in
  [`docs/CORAL_SPAGHETTI_DETECTION.md`](docs/CORAL_SPAGHETTI_DETECTION.md)
  and [`scripts/train/README.md`](scripts/train/README.md).
- **Network load & cadence**: detection analyses one frame per second
  by default — raise it via `--detect-interval` / `DETECT_INTERVAL`
  (service config) if you want it lazier. Note what does and does not
  cost network: the camera stream itself is the only real traffic (the
  printer sends one continuous JPEG flow ("MJPEG"), a few Mbit/s, to
  the server; every UI
  viewer pulls its own copy from the server), while the detection adds
  nothing — it just picks frames from that shared stream. A Telegram
  alert costs one ~25 KB image.
- **Default action is notify only**: evidence frames land in
  `data/evidence/` (and optionally a webhook). Arming `pause|stop`
  additionally requires `--enable-control`. The armed action **persists
  across service restarts**; `DETECT_ACTION` in the config is only the
  initial default.
- **Ship models in pairs**: an Edge-TPU-compiled `*_edgetpu.tflite` cannot
  execute on the CPU — the CPU fallback automatically loads the uncompiled
  sibling (`<name>.tflite`).
- **Optional Telegram push**: with `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` / `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`
  (in `/etc/pycentauri.conf`, or `--telegram-token` / `--telegram-chat-id`
  on the CLI) every alert goes to your chat — a one-liner with the camera
  frame. This covers detections **and** print-state changes (paused,
  filament switch, aborted, finished, error). Setup: create a bot via
  @BotFather, message it once, read the chat id from
  `https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/getUpdates`. Empty values
  disable it.
- Standalone without the HTTP server: `centauri detect watch --host …`.
  Model debugging against arbitrary JPEGs: `centauri detect test img.jpg`.
- Any SSD TFLite detector with `TFLite_Detection_PostProcess` outputs and a
  `.txt` label sidecar works.

### Trained model & training data attribution

A trained 1-class spaghetti model (SSD MobileNet V2 320×320) ships as
assets of the [v0.13.0 release](https://github.com/tholterhus/pycentauri/releases/tag/v0.13.0):
`spaghetti_edgetpu.tflite` (the Coral variant),
`spaghetti.tflite` (int8, the CPU sibling),
`spaghetti-float32.tflite`, `spaghetti.txt` (labels) and
`model-result.zip` (the original export bundle).

**One manual step is required**: the pip package does not bundle any
model — download the files above into `data/models/` (the installer
only auto-fetches the COCO *smoke* model as a pipeline test) and point
`DETECT_MODEL` at `data/models/spaghetti_edgetpu.tflite`. Then run
`centauri detect check`; details in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

The model was trained on 7,295 images / 13,791 boxes assembled from:

- "3D Printer Spaghetti Detection" dataset by training-l9tjj (Roboflow
  Universe, Public Domain)
- "Spaghetti" dataset by aiot-innowork (Roboflow Universe, CC BY 4.0) —
  modified: only the spaghetti class subset used
- Base architecture: SSD MobileNet V2 320×320, TensorFlow Object
  Detection API (Apache-2.0)

## Print status codes

`print_status` in the API and library uses the CC1 firmware's code
space, extended with three codes for CC2 Canvas operations:

| Code | Meaning | | Code | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Idle | | 13 | Printing |
| 1 | Homing | | 14 | Error |
| 5 | Pausing | | 15 | Leveling |
| 6 | Paused | | 16 | Preheating |
| 7 | Stopping | | **27** | **Switching filament** (CC2) |
| 8 | Stopped | | **28** | **Filament load complete** (CC2) |
| 9 | Completed | | **29** | **Unloading filament** (CC2) |

The full table (including CC1's resin-inherited codes) is in
[`docs/PROTOCOL.md`](docs/PROTOCOL.md).

On the CC2, mid-print Canvas filament switches are detected by head
position: the firmware never fully leaves its "printing" state during a
switch, but the head parks at the purge chute behind the bed (y ≥ 258 mm,
physically outside the printable area) for the duration. pycentauri
reports code 27 the entire time the head is parked there mid-print.

## Safety model

- **Explicit opt-in for writes.** Every surface requires
  `enable_control=True` / `--enable-control` before any state-changing
  command is possible. Read-only is the default everywhere.
- **Bounds-checked heaters.** The library refuses temperature targets
  outside nozzle 0–300 °C / bed 0–110 °C / chamber 0–60 °C even though
  the firmware might accept them.
- **Unauthenticated HTTP surface.** The REST server has no auth of its
  own. Bind it to loopback (the default) or put an authenticating
  reverse proxy in front before exposing it beyond localhost.
- **You own unattended printing.** An agent with control tools can pause,
  stop, or heat your printer. Leaving one unattended is your call.

## Known firmware quirks

### CC1 (original Centauri Carbon)

- **5 concurrent WebSocket slots, hard.** The 6th connection gets HTTP
  500 `"too many client"`. Slots free on close. The CLI opens one per
  invocation; the HTTP/MCP servers hold exactly one long-lived slot.
- **Paused/errored states don't push Attributes.** Every SDCP command
  needs the printer's `MainboardID`, which normally arrives in an
  Attributes push — but not while paused or errored. pycentauri
  pre-seeds it from UDP discovery on every connect. If you call
  `Printer.connect()` on a paused printer without discovery, pass
  `mainboard_id=` yourself.
- **Unknown commands crash the firmware.** A few unrecognised SDCP
  commands in quick succession kill the printer's `app` daemon — and any
  active print with it. Don't probe undocumented command codes against a
  printer that's doing something you care about.
- **The push scheduler goes dormant at idle (and a reboot doesn't wake
  it).** The firmware can enter a state where `Cmd 512` subscribes are
  acknowledged but no status frame is ever pushed while the printer
  sits idle — persisting across reboots (verified 2026-07-05 on
  V0.3.0-o). Starting a print revives pushes at full rate. One-shot
  `Cmd 0` requests always work, so pycentauri automatically falls back
  to polling when a subscribe goes quiet (~7 s updates at idle,
  full-rate pushes while printing). Clients that rely purely on
  subscribe pushes will hang forever on an idle printer in this state.

### CC2 (Centauri Carbon 2)

- **No UDP discovery.** The CC2 ignores broadcast probes; specify its IP
  explicitly. Give it a static DHCP lease — it doesn't register a
  hostname with most routers, so its address drifts otherwise.
- **Access code required for MQTT**, passed as the password with
  username `elegoo`. The HTTP bootstrap (`/system/info`) wants the same
  code as an `X-Token` *query parameter* — it ignores the header form.
- **The webcam is unauthenticated.** MJPEG on `:8080` (any path) is open
  to anyone on your LAN, access code or not. That's the firmware's
  choice, not ours.
- **Rate limiting.** Rapid-fire MQTT requests (3+ back-to-back) trip a
  cooldown of a few seconds during which the broker silently drops
  responses. pycentauri's polling cadence stays under it; your scripts
  should too.
- **The firmware resets the speed mode to balanced on every Canvas
  filament switch.** pycentauri pins your chosen mode and re-applies it
  automatically, while still honoring a deliberate balanced from the
  touchscreen — see
  [CC2 speed pinning](#cc2-speed-pinning-the-firmware-fights-you-so-pycentauri-fights-back)
  above for how it tells the two apart.
- **Registrations expire without an app-level PING.** The printer
  forgets a registered client after several quiet minutes and silently
  stops answering that session's requests — the MQTT connection itself
  stays up, so there's no error to catch. pycentauri sends the SDK's
  `{"type": "PING"}` keepalive every 30 s to hold the registration; if
  you write your own client, you must too.
- **File list (method 1044) and video stream (1042) don't respond** on
  firmware 01.03.02.51, so remote print-start on CC2 requires knowing
  the filename in advance.

  detail: envelopes, command/method tables with tested-on dates, status
  payloads, error codes, failure modes, and a CC1-vs-CC2 comparison.

## Development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tholterhus/pycentauri && cd pycentauri
python -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e ".[mcp,server,dev]"

.venv/bin/ruff check . && .venv/bin/ruff format --check .
.venv/bin/mypy src          # strict mode
.venv/bin/pytest -q         # no printer required — tests use in-process fakes
```

Tests run against an in-process fake SDCP WebSocket server plus pure
translation-layer tests for CC2; nothing in CI touches real hardware.
Live verification against a physical printer is manual — `centauri
status`, `centauri canvas`, and a fan write are the standard smoke
test after protocol-layer changes.

## Credits & license

- **Original project: [`bjan/pycentauri`](https://github.com/bjan/pycentauri)**
  — this repository started as a fork of its v0.9.0 (see the fork notice
  above and [`docs/FORK.md`](docs/FORK.md)).
- **AI-generated code**: everything added in this fork since the v0.9.0
  base — including the failed-print detection, the trained model and the
  dashboard — was written 100 % by AI (GLM-Flash 5.3, driven through
  ZCode). No humans were actively involved in the coding process (or
  were harmed); a human decided *what* to build, the machine wrote *how*
  — and upstream's v0.9.0 base may well have been built the same way.
